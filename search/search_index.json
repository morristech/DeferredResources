This allows the resolver (Activity, Fragment, or View) to be agnostic to the source (standard resources, attributes, or values fetched from an API), and allows repository/configuration layers to remain ignorant of Android's Context. Example In the logic layer, declare the resource values however you like, without worrying about their resolution or about Context: // Resource/attribute-based text and color: class LocalViewModel : MyViewModel { override fun getText (): DeferredText = DeferredText . Resource ( R . string . someText ) override fun getTextColor (): DeferredColor = DeferredColor . Attribute ( R . attr . colorOnBackground ) } // API-based text and color: class RemoteViewModel ( private val api : Api ) : MyViewModel { override fun getText (): DeferredText = DeferredText . Constant ( api . fetchText ()) override fun getTextColor (): DeferredColor = DeferredColor . Constant ( api . fetchTextColor ()) } In the view layer, resolve a deferred resource to display it: val text : DeferredText = viewModel . getText () val textColor : DeferredColor = viewModel . getTextColor () textView . text = text . resolve ( context ) textView . setTextColor ( textColor . resolve ( context )) With view extensions, this is even simpler. The View's own Context is used to resolve any deferred resource types: textView . setText ( viewModel . getText ()) textView . setTextColor ( viewModel . getTextColor ()) Import To use Deferred Resources, add the library as a dependency to your Android module: dependencies { implementation \"com.backbase.oss.deferredresources:deferred-resources:$version\" implementation \"com.backbase.oss.deferredresources:deferred-resources-view-extensions:$version\" }","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#deferred-resources","text":"Deferred Resources is an Android library that decouples resource declaration (without Context) from resource resolution (with Context).

Add a few extension functions for accessibility to the view extensions library, including setContentDescription . Use AppCompat to improve DeferredColor and DeferredDrawable implementations on Android OS versions < 23. In particular, default DeferredColor implementations can resolve attribute-backed color selectors, and default DeferredDrawable implementations can resolve vector drawables and tints correctly. Compile with Kotlin 1.4.10 and publish the source code in explicit mode . Target Android SDK 30. 1.0.0 2020-07-29 \ud83d\ude80 Official stable release! Add DeferredColor.resolveToStateList to support resolving color <selector> elements from XML resources and attributes. 0.5.1 2020-07-22 Update internal DeferredColor.Resource and DeferredColor.Attribute logic to resolve the default color of color selector resources instead of crashing. 0.5.0 2020-07-14 Breaking change : Update DeferredDrawable.Resource's transformations constructor parameter to receive the resolving Context as a parameter. This breaks binary compatibility by removing constructors with a Function1 parameter in their signature (replaced by a Function2 parameter). This also breaks source compatibility for Java consumers but not for Kotlin consumers. Add deferred-resources-view-extensions to simplify use of Deferred Resources with Views. Basic extensions are provided for View, TextView, and ImageView. Add DeferredColorWithAlpha along with a corresponding withAlpha extension on DeferredColor , to make alpha transformations on unresolved DeferredColor s simple. 0.4.0 2020-06-23 Add DeferredDimension.Attribute to support dimension attribute resolution. Add DeferredText.resolveToString as a convenience for converting the resolve CharSequence to a string. Update minimum supported Java version to Java 8. 0.3.1 2020-06-17 Add the @Px annotation to the integer pixel value parameter of DeferredDimension.Constant 's convenience constructor. 0.3.0 2020-06-09 Add a text package with various text helpers allowing conversion formatted and/or pluralized text and regular deferred text when partial resolution information is known (i.e. format arguments and/or quantity). Add DeferredColorDrawable as a convenience for deferred creation of a solid-color Drawable. Add a convenience constructor for parsing a color string to create a DeferredColor.Constant . 0.2.0 2020-05-22 Add DeferredTypeface , DeferredIntegerArray , and DeferredTextArray . 0.1.0 2020-05-15 Initial preview release.
